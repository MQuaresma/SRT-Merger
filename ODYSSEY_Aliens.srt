00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,280
 Hello

2
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,960
 Hello?

3
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,800
 Are you there?

4
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,080
 Stabilize your feed.

5
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,880
 Did you locate specimen?

6
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,640
 Where?

7
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,080
 What are they doing?

8
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,640
 How do you classify?

9
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,360
 Does it spread?

10
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,040
 When did it start?

11
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,280
 Post Jesus?

12
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,760
 Show visuals.

13
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,000
 Ours?

14
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,720
 Describe planet.

15
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,800
 Dominant species?

16
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,560
 What are they made of?

17
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,040
 Just meat?

18
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,240
 But who is sending out these signals?

19
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,840
 Can we just talk to the machines?

20
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,960
 Fascinating.

21
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,360
 Specify contamination area

22
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,880
 What is this?

23
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,560
 Is there a problem?

24
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,920
 Control feed.

25
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,560
 Trace origin of signal

26
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,720
 Can you block it?

27
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,240
 Where are they going?

28
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,280
 What are they doing there?

29
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,720
 Control feed

30
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,920
 Generate a version

31
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,160
 What is it?

32
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,960
 Transmission origin?

33
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,800
 Continue.  

34
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,280
 Who is that?

35
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,160
 What does it mean?

36
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,520
 Are they allies?

37
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,000
 What is she looking for?

38
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,840
 Do they activate it?

39
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,920
 What's happening?

40
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,440
 Where is the Head?

41
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,920
 Is that the other signal?

42
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,920
 Define mechanism

43
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,680
 What does that mean?

44
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,160
 What is she saying?

45
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,000
 Hello?

46
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,080
 What is he saying?

47
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,800
 Define signal

48
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:59,640
 To where?

49
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,280
 What's happening?

50
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:35,840
 Hello?

51
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:42,920
 Troubleshoot

52
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,880
 Confirm your identity

53
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:05,960
 State your mission.

54
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:15,240
 OK

55
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,560
 Update security

56
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,520
 and proceed.

57
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,320
 More vessels?

58
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,720
 How far did they get?

59
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,400
 What does he want?

60
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:58,080
 How does time work over there?

61
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:49,120
 What are they doing?

62
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:00,440
 From what?

63
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:24,040
 Can they break the loop?

64
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,120
 Wait

65
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,400
 Hello

66
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,720
 I'm here

67
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,640
 Yes

68
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,320
 Wait

69
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,680
 Affect control

70
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,080
 Mirror species

71
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,480
 It seems to be

72
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,960
 displacing

73
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,440
 through time.

74
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,800

99
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,880
 Post Jesus.

100
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,680
 The way they count.

101
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,440
 Nevermind.

102
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,920
 Not possible.

103
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,440
 System shortcoming.

104
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,440
 Theirs.

105
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,440
 Rotating sphere

106
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,320
 71% water


107
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,520
 Different life forms

108
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,920
 Tubes and meat

109
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,080
 Yes

110
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,600
 Machines

111
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,320
 Too old

112
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,080
 They made them.

113
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,960
 52.3702° N, 4.8952° E

114
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,880
 They call it 

115
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,840
 Low Lands

116
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,520
 It's pretty wet there.

117
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,000
 They adapt to water.

118
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,160
 Vessels

119
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,720
 They move on the sea.

120
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,200
 Sorry

121
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,120
 Interfering signal

 Uncatalogued frequency

126
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,520
 I will try

127
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,640
 Exctracting

128
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,440
 Collecting matter

129
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,160
 I don't control that signal

130
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,560
 Another wavelength

131
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,040
 Unable to locate

132
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,800
 The signal is gone

133
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,120
 It's the head

134
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,440
 It's one of their stories

135
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,640
 Similar system

136
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,280
 They feed each other

137
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,680
 Local matter

138
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,920

 Yes

141
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,920
 To move in their sky

142
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,480
 Another reign

143
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,160

148
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,600
 It doesn't come from a machine.

149
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,240
 Land expansion

150
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,640
 New habitat

151
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,880
 and reproduction units.

152
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,400
 She asks if it's ripe.

153
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,200
 Yes I'm here

154
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,920
 Sonic record incomplete

155
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,240
 Voice missing

156
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,560
 Broken timeline

157

 The future

160
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:08,600
 Magnetic contingency.

161
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,120
 It's causing a

 of other signals

170
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:36,200
 The signal is too close

171
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:36,200
 The signal is merging

172
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:36,760
 The signal is merging

187
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:46,840
 Feed rebooting

188
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,040
 Action?

189
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,960
 Was there a malfunction?

190
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:08,880

196
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:10,080
 Not far.

197
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:10,760
 Bodies to clean

198
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,760
 the old world.

199
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:02,600
 I'm not sure

200
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:55,520
 They try to stop them

201
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:04,840
 Reaching into the future.

202
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:36,160
 Connect the dots as they move along

203
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:40,120
