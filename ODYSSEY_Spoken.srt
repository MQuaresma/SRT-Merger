1
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,000
 I am convinced
 I took on a difficult task

2
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,320
 by accepting to govern Suriname.   

3
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:09,720
 But nevertheless I go towards 
the future full of courage.

4
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,600
 And were all 
the masters cruel?

5
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,200
 Your grandmother.. 
How did she experience this?

6
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,440
 Once they were adults

7
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:20,080
 they were summoned to the boss.

8
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,680
 And they were told:
you have to...

9
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,080
 This man,

10
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,480
 this boy,

11
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,200
 you have to "go with him",
let's say.

12
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,600
 This is your man
from now on

13
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,760
 and you need
 to make babies.

14
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,160
 So if no children came...

15
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,240
  Then they just had
 to make sure that...

16
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,840
 Maybe another man,
or the man with another female.

17
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,760
 But children had to come.

18
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:48,000
 Because that is in
 the plantation’s interest.

19
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:14,000
 I am pleased to announce

20
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,480
 that I have signed
 my abdication 

21
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,160
 to my daughter
 Queen Juliana.

22
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,040
 And I am happy
 I can exclaim with you,

23
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,520
 long live our queen!

24
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,800
 Hooray!

25
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,760
 Hooray!

26
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,560
 Hooray!

27
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,080
 I thank you dear mother,

28
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,600
 that you have initiated me
 in this way.

29
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,560
 Long live the fatherland!

30
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,960
 In my opinion,

31
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,600
 The well being and survival 
of the Dutch people

32
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,880
 can only be guaranteed

33
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:28,840
 by creating an alliance 
of all Germanic people. 

34
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,160
 Song number 5

35
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,600
 As for the Netherlands,

36
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,080
 they prefer to say
 "a little bit"

37
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,440
 through the voice
 of Teddy Scholten.

38
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,480
 A little bit.

39
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,880
 Everyone falls in love
you know that.

40
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,800
 You want to be wise
but you forget.

41
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,480
 As soon as you
whisper to me.

42
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,240
 Listen to me.

43
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,640
 Then you know.

44
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,120
 This will be like
Faust and Greetje.

45
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,960
 With Henry Voetjens
in a little cafe.

46
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,480
 And walking in the moonshine.

47
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:06,120
 I'll ask you where you 
want to live in The Netherlands 

48
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,600
 Make sure you give
 this some thought.

49
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:10,840
 But one thing.

50
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,480
 You cannot live in Amsterdam.

51
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,280
 You cannot live in The Hague.

52
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,320
 Can't live in Rotterdam.

53
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,560
 And you can't live in Utrecht.

54
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:23,080
 Those places are
 completely full.

55
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:39,960
 This year's increase 
in migration from Suriname

56
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:44,040
 is confronting our society 
with very serious problems.

57
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,320
 The government appreciates
that so many people

58
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:52,640
 are willing to contribute
 to finding solutions

59
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,720
 for shelter and guidance

60
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:57,760
 housing and employment.

61
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:04,080
 The Bureau of Citizen Spreading Policy

62
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,680
 plans to temporarily 
house 500 Surinamese

63
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,640
 in this recreational park

64
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,760
 located just outside
 of Stavenisse.

65
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,960
 So we are strongly opposed

66
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,480
 to the number.

67
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,280
 We think it's too high.

68
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,160
 As pastor of the old 
Reformed congregation

69
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:32,560
 I fear we will face 
a Babelonic confusion.

70
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,000
 Boys and girls
 couple together

71
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,720
 we know how that goes.

72
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:40,240
 Stavenisse has always been 
a peaceful village.

73
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,040
 Now the peace is gone. 

74
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:48,640
 I don't think it will be easy,
500 strangers added.

75
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,440
 It's an isolated village.

76
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,960
 So if a Surinamer stands here 
and things go wrong,

77
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,720
 then there will be trouble.

78
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,720
 Hello Saint Nicolas.

79
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,960
 Yes, Santa sit, now.

80
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:36,080
 Sit down after
 plenty hard work.

81
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,320
 Yeah like that.

82
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,000
 Do I have a nice beard?

83
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,360
 Yes!

84
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,080
 You wish you had
 such a nice beard!

85
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:47,120
 Santa I no have beard yet..

86
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,240
 No...

87
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:49,360
 Now, Santa.

88
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,600
 I’m sure you’d like a
 song for your birthday.

89
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,800
 Yes, who wants
 to sing a song?

90
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:55,400
 —Me!

91
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,280
 Ok so come here you.

92
00:50:58,440 --> 00:50:59,080
 You can.

93
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:01,760
 And then I need
 to have a boy.

94
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,880
 This boy, come here.

95
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:09,280
 There, first I need
 to know your names.

96
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,000
 Come stand over here.

97
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,160
 There.

98
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,200
 Now you see Sint
 from up close.

99
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,480
 What's your name?

100
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:18,320
 Maureen.

101
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:20,000
 Maureen.

102
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,280
 -Marleen?

103
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,280
 Maureen.

104
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:23,320
 Maureen?

105
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:24,920
 Maureen!

106
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,160
 How?

107
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:27,680
 Maureen!

108
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:28,720
 Maureen.

109
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:29,680
 Beautiful.

110
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,920
 — And your name is?
 — Paul.

111
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:36,680
 Maureen and Paul are going 
 to sing a song together.

112
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,920
 We have to make
 an agreement

113
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:42,760
 imagine we choose 
 a song that you know

114
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:44,560
 and she doesn't.

115
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,560
 What do you know?

116
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:51,480
 Comes the steam...
—There comes the steamboat!

117
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,280
 Do you know this?
—Yes.

118
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:56,200
 Just these two guys!
 Listen carefully.

119
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:59,920
 See there comes
 the steamboat

120
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:03,560
 arriving from Spain

121
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:07,480
 It brings us St Nicolas

122
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,160
 I can see him
 standing there.

123
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:18,200
 His horse is jumping
 up and down the ship

124
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,080
 see the pennants waving

125
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:25,760
 back and forth in the wind.

126
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,240
 Beautiful.

127
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:59,920
 They have to be suitable
for the Dutch labour market

128
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,240
 No illiterates.

129
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,400
 Take a seat.

130
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:40,800
 You've been recruited to
 work in The Netherlands.

131
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,600
 I have cleaning job for you.

132
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:47,320
 You will clean rooms
in a hotel in The Netherlands.

133
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:50,040
 On a one year contract.
 Do you want this work?

134
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,600
 Yes Sir, I do.

135
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:52,960
 Very well. 

136
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,680
 And how old are you?

137
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:55,480
 21.

138
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:56,480
 21? 

139
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,680
 And could you

140
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,400
 depart within a week?

141
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:03,360
 Yes, agreed?

142
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:56,360
 In which part of the world
lies The Netherlands?

143
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:00,360
 In Europe.

144
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,720
 What is typically Dutch?

145
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:08,720
 Cycling.

146
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,960
 What does
 "The Netherlands" mean?

147
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:24,560
 Moments ago,

148
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:30,760
 I stepped down
 from government.

149
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:36,480
 I hereby introduce Beatrix,

150
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,280
 your new queen.

151
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:12,000
 Is The Netherlands
 often wet

152
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:13,520
 or dry?
